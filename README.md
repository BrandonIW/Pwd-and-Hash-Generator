# Pwd-and-Hash-Generator
Interactive program built in python. First allows you to customize password creation followed up the option to hash each created password

This program is one I built for a school project. The project currently relies on the popular "Rockyou.txt" password database for some of it's functioning, which can be downloaded else.

First the user interactively selects the types of passwords they'd like to create. Selections are based on level of complexity, length of the password, and whether or not the password is randomly generated or selected from the RockYou.txt database

Passwords are written to a file, and then you have the option to hash each written password via any or all of MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512
